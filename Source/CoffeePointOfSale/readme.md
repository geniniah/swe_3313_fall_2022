# This is the readme to help you execute our program properly
# 1st, so you understand what is going on, our final product is in our branch named "final" so the objective of this tutorial is to get you to run that branch

# Step one: If you haven't already, just clone our repostitory.
# I will note that, although our final edition of our project is in our "final" branch, everything else is still within the "main" branch, by that I mean all of our documentation

# Step two: Once you have cloned our repository and have the git terminal open, type "git checkout final" to switch to the final branch
# Step three: From here you can got to Source/CoffeePointOfSale and type "dotnet run" and it should run our final program
